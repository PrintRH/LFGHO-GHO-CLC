## 🧾 Project Overview
- Web3 GHO-based simple payment system and dNFT credit loan card payment system

## 📖 Project Description
- We aim to establish a new paradigm in the cryptocurrency market, not merely to address current issues but to achieve consensus between the existing world and the unfolding future.
In the current Web2 landscape, convenient payment systems exist through various applications. These are typically integrated with banks, card companies, and payment gateways, requiring user registration within each application. The evolution of payment systems from offline to online in Web2 has resulted in the current user experience (UX)-enhanced convenient payment systems.

- Our goal is to introduce cryptocurrencies into this convenient payment system and enable payments using GHO stablecoins. Moreover, the GHO payment system goes beyond simple transactions it aims to allow users to register and conduct payments using a credit loan card in the form of an NFT (Non-Fungible Token). This NFT card can be easily used for payments. By offering such a payment system, seek to establish a new paradigm in the Web3 ecosystem that coexists harmoniously with the existing Web2 ecosystem.

## 🛠️ Project How it's made
- Providing a multi-chain payment system using CCIP
- Offering a payment service where dNFTs dynamically update credit card limits, expiration dates, etc.
- Providing GHO token lending services through the Vault smart contract
- Offering fee delegation services and a convenient payment credit loan card wallet format service using the AA (Family Toolkit) feature.
